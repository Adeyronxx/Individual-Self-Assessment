# Individual-Self-Assessment


* Cohesive written analysis: 


For this final project, my team and I collaborated collectively on sourcing datasets that held some interest for us, from the options we were presented we decided on a dataset showing features/variables that contribute to the listed price of a house for a city in Iowa. This dataset was chosen due to the various changes experienced by the Housing Market since the pandemic.


With a decision made on the dataset, the role that each person chose was selected by that person as we wanted to work in our areas of interest. My role was to undertake the machine learning model, to do this I also had to explore and clean the dataset.


In undertaking this role, my major challenge was choosing the features to go into the model as some features have a better correlation to the sales price than others and our data set did not take market factors into consideration as they go a long way also to determine Housing Sales Price.
Ultimately, I decided to use all the provided features in the dataset. 


* Cohesive written summary:


With the role that I did not take on actively, I made contributions by going through my thought process in exploring and cleaning the data as my team members needed to understand this to perform their own roles.




# Project and Team Summary
For our project, our primary method of communication as a team included Zoom and Slack. We also exchanged phone numbers to make it easier and faster to reach out to one another when we needed to discuss certain aspects of the project.


My team members had unique strengths. For technical evaluation (Felipe), Presentation Organization (Clemonce), and Visualization (Derek). Each of them was a resource and the go-to person to discuss what was needed for each aspect of the project to be satisfactory.

The topic addressed by our project is, Predicting House Prices in the City of Ames, Iowa. For our machine learning model, we started out with 3 options but by making use of the Scikit Learn library we were able to access tools like Cross Validation and GridSearch to choose the best estimator based on the type of data we had available to us. The model used is the Gradient Boosting regressor.

* The Result:

Our prediction had a Mean Square Error of 24844.2130911. 

Given more time we would work on feature selection and trying out more hyperparameters.
